# Bioinformatics_Masters_Brandeis_University
I started taking courses to complete a masters of science in bioinformatics from Brandeis University in 2023. This repository contains projects from that program.

Below is a list of courses from the program I intend to take:

- Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Disease  
- Bioinformatics Scripting and Databases with Python  
- Structural Bioinformatics  
- Biological Sequence Analysis  
- Computational Systems Biology  
- Molecular Profiling and Biomarker Discovery  
- Drug Discovery and Development  
- Mathematical Modeling for Bioinformatics  
- Statistical Genetics  
- Research Topics in Computational Biology
